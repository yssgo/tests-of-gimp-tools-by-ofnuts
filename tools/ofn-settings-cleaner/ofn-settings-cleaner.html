<h1>ofn-settings-cleaner</h1>

<p>This utility keeps the memorized settings of various tools under control. It is not really a plug-in, even if it masquerades as such for its operation.</p>

<h2>Principles of operation</h2>

<p>Gimp keeps the settings of some tools in files </p>

<ul>
<li>in 2.8, a handful of files (corresponding to "Color'" tools) 
in the subdirectory <code>tool-options</code> of the user's profile. 
These files are named <code>gimp-{tool}-tool.settings</code>.</li>
<li>in 2.10, about 40 files (tools and GEGL filters)
in the subdirectory <code>filters</code> of the user's profile. 
These files are named <code>Gimp*-config.settings</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both Gimp versions these files contain: </p>

<ul>
<li>explicitly saved settings (to which a name is given) </li>
<li>anonymous settings, that just receive a time stamp. </li>
</ul>

<p>Gimp never removes anything from these files so the settings lists in the tools dialogs can become unwieldy.</p>

<p><code>ofn-settings-cleaner</code> attempts to put this under control by:</p>

<ul>
<li>dropping anonymous settings older that N days</li>
<li>truncating the resulting list to the N most recent ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "named" settings are not taken in account. </p>

<p>The utility runs as part of the Gimp startup, and cannot be explicitly started from a Gimp menu.</p>

<p>To be run, it is put in one of the directories that Gimp searches for plug-ins. 
When it notices an executable file that does not match a registered plug-in,
Gimp executes it to make the plug-in run its registration code. 
So <code>ofn-setting-cleaner</code> runs, but since it does not register, it is not added to the plug-ins,
and on next start-up, Gimp sees it again, and runs it again...</p>

<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>

<p>The Python file should be installed like any other python plug-in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moved/copied in one of the directories listed in <code>Edit&gt;Preferences&gt;Files&gt;Plug-ins</code></li>
<li>Made executable (Linux, OSX, and other Unixen)(the unzipped file is normally already executable)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration file</h3>

<p>The utility will not clean any file unless explicitly told to do so via the configuration file. 
The configuration should therefore contain one section for each settings file, named after the file, 
within brackets, like "[gimp-curves-tool.settings]". The section can define two values:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>max_count</code>: the maximum number of anonymous settings to keep. A max_count of 0 will of course remove all anonymous settings.</li>
<li><code>max_age</code>: the maximum age in days of anonymous settings to keep. This number can be fractional (for instance, "0.5" will clean everything older than 12 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p>A "[DEFAULT]" section can be used for values common to several sections</p>

<p>For example the following configuration file:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specifies the seven files to be cleaned</li>
<li>Sets a maximum age of <code>7</code> days for all</li>
<li><p>Sets a maximum count of <code>10</code> for most files, but this value is overridden with <code>5</code> for the <code>gimp-threshold-tool.settings</code> file. </p>

<pre>[DEFAULT]
max_age:7
max_count:10
[gimp-brightness-contrast-tool.settings]
[gimp-curves-tool.settings]
[gimp-levels-tool.settings]
[gimp-threshold-tool.settings]
max_count:5
[gimp-colorize-tool.settings]
[gimp-hue-saturation-tool.settings]
[gimp-color-balance-tool.settings]
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The configuration file should be named after the Python file (<code>ofn-settings-cleaner.ini</code> if you do not rename the python file) and kept in the subdirectory <code>tool-options</code> (Gimp 2.8) or <code>filters</code> (Gimp 2.10) of your profile.</p>

<p>Sample configuration files (<code>ofn-settings-cleaner.ini.sample-Gimp*</code>) that contains all known settings files as of Gimp 2.8.22 and Gimp 2.10.12 are provided in the ZIP.</p>

<h3>Log file</h3>

<p>Each run of the utility produces a log file ("ofn-settings-cleaner.log" if you do not rename the python file) in the subdirectory that contains the settings files. 
If the plug-in misbehaves, check that file, it could contain the explanation.</p>

<p>The configuration file can be used to tell how the log file is kept</p>

<pre>[logging]
log: single
</pre>

<ul>
<li>with <code>single</code> the log file is overwritten on each run, and so remains small.</li>
<li>with <code>cumulative</code> the log of each execution is added to the file. This lets you check the "history" but over time the file can grow quite big.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage notes</h3>

<p>Some versions of Gimp (2.8.4 for Windows at least) do not keep complete timestamps (with hours, minutes, and seconds), so the fractional age may not work. </p>
