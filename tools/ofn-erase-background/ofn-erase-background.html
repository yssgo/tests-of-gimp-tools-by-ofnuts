<h1>ofn-erase-background</h1>

<p>This script removes a uniform background from an image and makes it transparent, keeping clean and smooth
outlines around computer-generated graphics such as logos and text.</p>

<p>To use:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do a fuzzy selection ("wand tool') over the background. If necessary: 
<ul>
<li>shift-click on isolated sections such as loop in letters to add them to the general selection. </li>
<li>increase the selection threshold to include imperfections (such as JPEG compression artifacts)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Call the script: <code>Layer&gt;Erase background</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3><code>Delete color</code>:</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>Current background color</code>: the script erases the background paint color (that's the one shown in the toolbox indicator). 
This is a good choice on complicated backgrounds (use the color picker to set that color before starting the script).</li>
<li><code>Best guess from selection contents</code> : the script determines the most frequent color in the selected pixels and uses
it as the color to remove. This works well on background that are mostly uniform.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>Edges</code>:</h3>

<p>This option tells the script how deep it should work on the edges. The <code>Clean</code> edges don't need more than one pixel, 
the two other options will work with 2 and 3 pixels. Try the smaller values first, and increase the depth if necessary. </p>

<h2>Usage notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The result of the script depends on the accuracy of the background selection. 
A clean logo with sharp edges on a PNG image will just require a selection with a small threshold, 
but more difficult images (JPG with compression artifacts, for instance) may require a larger selection treshold,
or the selection to be grown by one or to pixels before calling the script. </li>
<li>The script works only on RGB images</li>
<li>You can also use it to make transparent any area with a uniform color</li>
</ul>
