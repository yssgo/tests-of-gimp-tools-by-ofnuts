<h1>ofn-interleave-layers</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This script creates a new image by interleaving layers in the stack of
layers of the current image.. It covers three different modes of operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Layers from the current image are interleaved with another stack
of layers from another image. This is typically used to combine two animations.</li>
<li>Layers from the current image are interleaved with copies of
single layer which is placed above them. This is typically used to add
a fixed image part (such as a title) to all frames in an animation.</li>
<li>Layers from the current image are interleaved with copies of a single
layer which is placed under them. This is typically used to add a
background to a mobile image (often called a "sprite").</li>
</ul>

<p>The top layer of each pair can be merged to the underlying layer with a
given transparency and layer mode. The first stack of layers comes from the
current image (the one through which the script is called).</p>

<p>In multiple-layer mode, the inserted layers come from another image
already loaded in Gimp, as specified in the script parameters dialog.</p>

<p>In single layer mode, the inserted layer can come from any loaded
image (including the one used as a source for the base layers)</p>

<p>Only visible layers of both images are used, so work layers can be
left out by making them invisible. In particular in the single layer over/under modes,
the layer can be a layer of that same image made invisible before calling the script.</p>

<p>The two images or the image and the layer should have the same size,
and for multiple-layer both stacks should hold the same number of visible layers.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The script is started by the <code>Image&gt;Interleave layers</code> menus.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Layers source</strong> (multiple-layer mode): The image from which the inserted layers are obtained. 
This is another image also opened in Gimp, not an image file from the disk.</li>
<li><strong>Layer</strong> (single-layer mode): The layer which is interleaved with the current image layers. 
This is a layer from the current image or from another image already opened in Gimp.</li>
<li><strong>Opacity</strong>: An opacity to be applied to all top layers.</li>
<li><strong>Mode</strong>: A layer mode to be applied to the top layer of each pair.</li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong>: If true, the top layers of each pair are directly merged into the other layers,
using the specified opacity and layer mode. The resulting layer is given the name of its component
from the source image.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage hints</h2>

<h3>Positioning the merged stacks in the result</h3>

<p><code>ofn-interleave-layers</code> requires that both images have the same canvas size. 
This is not a constraint, this is how you define where each layer stack ends up in the result,
which you can do using existing Gimp functionality. Here is how you can easily achieve
two frequent use cases:</p>

<h4>Combining two animations</h4>

<ul>
<li>Compute the total size of the canvas (add the widths if side-y-side or the height id on top of each other)</li>
<li><p>In each animation image: <code>Image&gt;Canvas size</code>, and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the canvas dimensions</li>
<li>Use the position widget to indicate where the current image will be in the bigger canvas:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="CanvasResize.webp" alt="Canvas resize][1" title=""></p>

<ul>
<li>It is often useful at that point to make sure that the layers in at least one of the stacks
span the whole canvas of the final image, which can be done with the <code>Resize layers</code> selector of the dialog.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can then merge the two animations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Positioning an animation over a background</h4>

<ul>
<li>Open the background image</li>
<li>Use <code>File&gt;Open as layers</code> to load all the animation layers</li>
<li>Chain-link the added layers:  shift-click the <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-dialogs-structure.html#gimp-layer-attributes">link icon</a> 
on any layer to link them all, then click on the background layer to unlink it from the rest.</li>
<li>Move one of the layers, this will move all the chained layers.</li>
</ul>
