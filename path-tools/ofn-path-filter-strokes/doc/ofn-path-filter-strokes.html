<h1>ofn-path-filter-strokes</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This script removes strokes from a path, based on the "size" of the stroke. This size criterion can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of anchors/segments
<li>The length
<li>The area (see Notes below) 
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once installed, this script appears in the right-click menu of the Paths list as <code>Tools>Filter strokes on size</code>
<p>The script doesn't delete the original path, it creates a new path which is a copy of the source path with some strokes removed.</p>
<p>The threshold value is tested for equality (the strokes for which the measure is equal to the theshold are kept)</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The computation of the stroke area is approximate, it is the area of the polygon going through the anchor points. 
The computation is only valid for "simple" (non-self-intersecting) polygons (paths created from a selection are alays of that kind)</p>
