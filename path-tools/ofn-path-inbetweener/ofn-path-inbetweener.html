<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This tool interpolates more paths between the current path and end path. This can be used to generate surfaces or line-based animations.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>End path</code>: The end path (the start path is the current one)</li>
<li><code>Total steps</code>: The number of steps to generate, including a copy of the begin and end paths.</li>
<li><code>Output</code>: what output is produced: 
<ul>
<li><code>Single</code>: a single path is produced, that contains all the generated strokes from all the paths</li>
<li><code>Multiple</code>: a path is generated for each iteration</li>
<li><code>Auto</code>: when start and end path have one single stroke, this is <code>Single</code>, else this is <code>Multiple</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Stretch</code>: The law that governs the spacing of the paths:
<ul>
<li><code>Linear</code>: the intermediate paths are evenly spaced</li>
<li><code>Accelerate</code>: the interval between paths widens from the start path to the end path. When used in an animation, 
this is the movement of a falling object.</li>
<li><code>Decelerate</code>: the interval between paths shrinks from the start path to the end path. When used in an animation, 
this is the movement of a decelerating object (a bouncing ball going up, for instance).</li>
<li><code>Swing</code>: the interval between paths widens and then shrinks. This is the movement of many oscillating systems
(pendulum, spring...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Use guide</code>, <code>Guide path</code>: specify a third path that skews the interpolation. In other words, anchors on the intermediate path are no longer on a straight line between the corresponding anchors on the start and end paths. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Quirks, gotchas and caveats</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The script interpolates the anchors of the paths, so it must match anchors in the first path with anchors in the second.</p></li>
<li><p>The matching algorithm is simplistic: the Nth point in the stroke from path 1 is matched with the Nth point
in the corresponding stroke in path 2, and the strokes themselves are matched by the order in which they appear in each path.</p></li>
<li><p>Hence both paths should have the same number of strokes, and the strokes, taken in the same order, should have the same number of
points. Working with single-stroke paths is therefore recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>The script takes the anchors as defined in the Gimp strokes. It is recommended to check that:</p>

<ul>
<li>When working with closed strokes, the starting point of matching strokes in the two paths are the required ones </li>
<li>In all cases, that the order of anchors (i.e., the direction) is the same in matching strokes.</li>
</ul>

<p><p>Both cases can be checked with the <code>Summary</code> function in my <code>ofn-path-edits</code> script (which can also reverse selected 
strokes if necessary)</p></li>
<li><p>When done, both source paths and the guide path are made invisible, while the generated paths are made visible 
(so you are one click away from "Merge visible paths" if needed).</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that in Gimp 2.6, an even number of identical paths cancel out each other on the display. Not seeing
anything could be normal (but who uses Gimp 2.6 in 2019?).</p></li>
</ul></p>
