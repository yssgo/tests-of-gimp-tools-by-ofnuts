<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>This script is about "paths", so this documentation makes a heavy use of path concepts and terminology.</p>

<p>For some introductory information on Gimp's paths, see <a href="https://www.gimp-forum.net/Thread-Paths-Basics">here</a>
and <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-using-paths.html">there</a>.</p>

<h1>ofn-text-along-path</h1>

<p>This tool attempts to improve on the <code>Text along path</code> function in Gimp's Text tool. The improvements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Character shapes are not distorted: while Gimp's tool works by remapping the text path control points using the guide path, 
this script rotates and moves each character path without distortion.</li>
<li>Text can left-aligned, right-aligned, centered, justified, or repeated on the path.</li>
<li>The vertical position with respect to the guide path can be specified</li>
<li>The path of individual characters can be obtained</li>
<li>Some more frivolous options may appeal to the artist or the ransom note writer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like the Gimp's native version, it produces a path.</p>

<p>There are two different functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the first one, one single piece of text is used over every stroke in the path.</li>
<li>In the second one (a.k.a. multi) several pieces of text are used, one for each stroke of the path.</li>
</ul>

<p>This script is called from the <strong>Paths list dialog</strong>, by right-clicking on the path used as a guide for the text, It appears in the <code>Tools</code> sub-menu (at the bottom of the menu elicited by the right-click). </p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Text</h3>

<p>The text. </p>

<ul>
<li>In standard mode this is just one line of text, which should fit the shortest stroke in the guide path. </li>
<li>In "multi" mode, each piece of text should be on its own line and be short enough to fit the corresponding stroke. 
There should be exactly as many lines as there are strokes in the guide path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spacer</h3>

<p>The characters to be inserted between each repetition of the text, when using the <code>Repeated</code> layout. On an open stroke,
this spacer is only inserted between copies of the text, and is not added to either end. 
On a closed stroke, it is added to each instance of the text, so that the text+spacer cycle repeats over the whole stroke.</p>

<h3>Font name</h3>

<p>The font to use. If this is left blank, the script will use the current Gimp font (the one used in the Text tool).</p>

<h3>Font size</h3>

<p>The font size (in pixels).</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>

<p>How the text is placed on the guide path stroke. Possible layouts are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Left-aligned</code>: the text its kept at its native width, and starts at the beginning of the stroke.</li>
<li><code>Right-aligned</code>: the text its kept at its native width, and ends on the end of the stroke.</li>
<li><code>Centered</code>: the text its kept at its native width, and is centered in the stroke.</li>
<li><code>Justified</code>: extra space is added between the characters, so that the text is made exactly wide enough to fill the whole stroke length.</li>
<li><code>Repeated</code>: the text is repeated as many times as can fit in the stroke, and then widened to exactly fit the stroke. 
If specified, a copy of the <code>spacer</code> text is inserted between each copy of the text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use kerning</h3>

<p>The script attempts to space the letters more evenly by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning">kerning</a>.
The kerning is obtained indirectly and may not work for all fonts; in particular, it is best left out for italic fonts.</p>

<p><img src="Kerning.png" alt="Kerning][1" title=""></p>

<h3>Extra spacing</h3>

<p>Extra space inserted between all characters, to widen the text. Partial pixel values are allowed. 
This is useful to give a bit more room to characters and avoid overlaps when the path stroke has a tight curve or when using the <code>tilt wiggle</code>. 
The <code>Justified</code> layout ignores this value, while the <code>Repeated</code> layout uses it as a minimum value (but the actual character spacing can be wider).</p>

<h3>Height reference</h3>

<p>How the text is positioned vertically with respect to the guide path. The <code>box</code> in the choices is the boundary of the text layer that would hold the characters in the Text tool.</p>

<p><img src="HeightReference.png" alt="HeightReference][1" title=""></p>

<p>The actual height for <code>Top of Uppercase</code>, <code>Middle of Uppercase</code>, <code>Top of Lowercase</code>, <code>Middle of Lowercase</code>, 
is computed by examining a rendering of the uppercase and lowercase of variants of <code>X</code>. This may not work for "artistic" fonts.</p>

<h3>Vertical adjust</h3>

<p>Height adjustment, added to the <code>height reference</code> above. Partial pixel values are allowed.</p>

<h3>Keep upright</h3>

<p>When this is true, characters are not tilted to follow the guide path.</p>

<p><img src="KeepUpright.png" alt="KeepUpright][1" title=""></p>

<h3>Lateral wiggle</h3>

<p>The maximum value for a random lateral displacement of each character. It is expressed as a percent 
of the average character width.</p>

<h3>Vertical wiggle</h3>

<p>The maximum value for a random vertical displacement of each character. It is expressed as a percent 
of the height of the <code>character box</code>.</p>

<h3>Tilt wiggle</h3>

<p>The maximum value for a random additional tilt for each character, in degrees.</p>

<p><img src="Wiggles.png" alt="Wiggles][1" title=""></p>

<h3>Reverse stroke direction</h3>

<p>When this is true, the characters are laid by walking the path strokes in the opposite direction. This also puts the characters
on the other side of the strokes. If the path is made of several strokes, this applies to <strong>all</strong> the strokes.</p>

<p><img src="Reversed.png" alt="Reverse][1" title=""></p>

<h3>Generate, Show boxes as paths</h3>

<p>These two options provide several ways to generate the paths. </p>

<p><code>Show boxes as paths</code> is initially meant for debugging. It generates a square path around the character box, 
making more obvious how/why the character path is positioned. It was left in because it can have more artistic uses.
Its actual output depends on the <code>Generate</code> selection.</p>

<p><code>Generate</code> is the main option, the possible values are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>One single path</code>: a single path is created to hold all character output. If boxes are requested, an additional path is created for them.</li>
<li><code>One path per stroke</code>: a path is created for the characters laid out on each stroke of the guide path. This is typically used for animation.
If boxes are requested, an additional path is created for each stroke.</li>
<li><code>Separate text and spacer paths</code>: two paths are created, one for all the characters from the <code>Text</code> input, and one for all the characters 
from the <code>Spacer</code> input. This is useful if these classes of characters do not receive the same post-processing (color, etc...).
If boxes are requested, two additional paths are created, one of the text boxes and one for the spacer boxes.</li>
<li><code>One path per character</code>: A path is created for each character. If boxes are requested, the boxes are added to that same path, 
so that each path contains a character and its box.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage notes</h2>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<p>The script can use any character that you can enter in the dialog and that is present in the font. 
This means that with a standard font, you have the whole set of Unicode symbols available, including
emojis and such. These non-alphabetic characters are not available on a regular keyboard but can be copy/pasted
from some character map (or a web page that displays them). </p>

<h3>Path</h3>

<p>The script runs on all strokes of the path, considering each stroke as a separate unit. 
If things don't seem to work, search for overlooked strokes (typically, single-point ones).</p>

<h3>Stroke origin and direction</h3>

<p>The text is laid out on the stroke from its starting point to its ending point. 
In most cases, open strokes run from left to right and closed strokes run clockwise. 
If the path contains a single stroke, the <code>Reverse</code> option can be used to work around this. 
If there are several strokes, this option is useful only if they are all in the wrong direction. 
See below for a script that can reverse the direction of specific strokes in a path. </p>

<p>Stroke origin is difficult to determine on closed strokes such as circles. 
<a href="https://www.gimp-forum.net/Thread-Paths-Basics">This short write-up</a> expounds a
technique to change the stroke origin of a closed stroke.</p>

<h3>Sports patches and other circular uses</h3>

<p>A typical use of this script is to put text around a circle. This text is very often split in two parts, one around the top and
one around the bottom. To make sure the text is centered at the top and bottom, there are two solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keeping the full circle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the circle starts and ends on the 6 hours mark</li>
<li>Position the top text (using the <code>Centered</code> layout)</li>
<li>Duplicate the circle path, and flip it vertically with the Flip tool (in <code>Flip Path</code> mode of course)</li>
<li>Position the bottom text (using the <code>Centered</code> layout). Flipping the circle has the side effect of reversing its direction
so there is no need to use the <code>Reverse path direction</code> option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Splitting the circle (this can be used only if both top and bottom texts are shorter than a half-circle):</p>

<ul>
<li>Add anchors along the horizontal diameter if there are no such anchors </li>
<li>Duplicate the circle</li>
<li>Cut the bottom half on one, and the top half on the other</li>
<li>Position the top text (using the <code>Centered</code> layout)</li>
<li>Position the bottom text (using the <code>Centered</code> layout). You will normally have to use the <code>Reverse path direction</code> on that one.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>A result, using a flipped path, the Unicode "Anchor" symbol (<code>U+2693</code>) and the "Roboto Bold" font:</p>

<p><img src="CircleAndSymbols.png" alt="Circle and Symbols][1" title=""></p>

<p>To make sure that the text is laid out the same way at the top and bottom, either use <code>Middle of Uppercase/Lowercase</code> for both 
text parts, or use <code>Top of Uppercase/Lowercase</code> for one and <code>Baseline</code> for the other.</p>

<h3>Path generation</h3>

<p>To keep things reasonaly simple, the path generation options have been restricted to the more useful cases.
It is possible to combine them by repeating the script with different generation options and discarding
the unecessary output.</p>

<h3>Other useful scripts</h3>

<p>See my <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gimp-path-tools/files/scripts/">ofn-path-edits</a> for several functions that can help:</p>

<ul>
<li>Determining the strokes of a path: number, order, and their start/end points</li>
<li>Reversing a stroke</li>
<li>Extracting a stroke from a path</li>
<li>Splicing strokes together</li>
</ul>

<p>See my <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gimp-path-tools/files/scripts/">ofn-path-to-shape</a> to easily create circles with 
known anchors, and also easily create concentric circles. </p>
