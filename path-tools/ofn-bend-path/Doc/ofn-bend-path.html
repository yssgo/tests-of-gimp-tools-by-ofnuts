<h1>ofn-bend-path</h1>

<p>This script bends a path using the strokes of another path as an envelope. 
It can be seen as an equivalent of the "Curve Bend" tool. Unlike other scripts
with the same purpose, this script only remaps the path control points and does not
create new ones (it may move a few, see <code>Bendiness</code> below). </p>

<p>The script is called by right-clicking the path to bend <strong>in the Paths dialog</strong>  and clicking <code>Tools&gt;Bend...</code>.</p>

<h2>Typical use</h2>

<ul>
<li>Given a source path which is the path on which you start the script (active path or else) (in red)</li>
<li>You provide an envelope path made of two strokes (in blue)</li>
<li>The script produces the bent path (in green)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Conceptually, in addition to the source path (green) and the envelope path (yellow), you define two horizontal reference lines (blue). 
Space (and the source path on it) is then stretched vertically to fit these two reference lines over the envelope lines.
The final result (red) depends on the position of these lines with regard to the source path:</p>

<p><img src="Guides.png" alt="guides" title=""></p>

<ul>
<li>By design, the script only bends the path vertically (in the image above, you can observe that the vertical limits
of the characters in the source and bent paths are aligned). </li>
<li>The source path can be elsewhere, it only needs to overlap vertically with the envelope strokes 
(which should both be at least as wide as the source path).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<h3><code>Envelope path</code></h3>

<p>The path with the two strokes that define the envelope. Stroke order and direction is indifferent. 
In addition to the position and size requirements mentioned, some restrictions apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>There should be only two strokes in that path.</li>
<li>The strokes should not have loops.</li>
<li>One of the strokes should have its extremities above the corresponding extremities 
of the other one, so that the script can figure out which is the top and which is the bottom. 
Hint: you can add segments outside the range of the target path to put the extremities
in the right order.</li>
<li>Both strokes should cover at least the same range of X coordinates as the target path.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>Bendiness</code></h3>

<p>The amount of artificial bend to apply to straight path segments. </p>

<p>In Gimp paths, straight path segments are
created by having the tangent control points exactly over the anchors. So, in the result path, these points
are mapped to identical points, are therefore are still overlapping and the result is still a straight line, 
which may not look good. 
To avoid this, the script moves the tangent points somewhere between the two anchors, so that the remapping 
naturally transforms the straight line into a curve. Note however that this curve cannot be exactly the same 
as the one you would get by interpolating intermediate points (even if it will  be close). 
Bendiness above 100% may generate loops and cusps, so use with caution.</p>

<h3><code>Reference lines</code></h3>

<p>The vertical coordinates of the two reference lines. </p>

<p>The options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Best fit</code>: the script computes the maximum and minimum Y coordinates for the source path. The net effect 
is that the limits of your path will be very close to the envelope. However:
<ul>
<li>This includes both anchors and tangent handles, so the higher and lower anchors may not be on the envelope limits.</li>
<li>In text, some round letters (<code>O</code>,<code>C</code>, <code>G</code>...) may extend slightly below the baseline so the baseline will 
not map to the lower envelope limit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Guides</code>:  the script expects to find exactly two horizontal guides, whose position will be used</li>
<li><code>Explicit values</code>: the script uses the values entered in the two fields below</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>Top coordinate</code>, <code>Bottom coordinate</code></h3>

<p>The positions of the reference lines when using <code>Explicit values</code> in <code>Reference lines</code></p>
